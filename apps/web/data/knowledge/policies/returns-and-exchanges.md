Our standard return window is **45 days** from the ship date. Items must be in resellable
condition with original packaging and accessories included.

## Return eligibility checklist

1. Verify the order number and customer email match the original invoice.
2. Inspect the item for wear, missing components, or damage caused by misuse.
3. Confirm the request falls within the 45-day window. Exceptions require operations approval.
4. For kits with consumables, ensure no more than 25% of the consumables have been used.

## Exchange process

- Submit an exchange authorization through the OMS using reason code `EX-ADJ`.
- Reserve replacement inventory before issuing a return label.
- Exchanges ship with carbon-neutral ground service unless the customer upgrades shipping.

## Refunds

| Payment method | Refund timeline |
| --- | --- |
| Credit/debit card | 5â€“7 business days |
| Store credit | Instant upon return scan |
| Gift card | Emailed within 24 hours |

## Exceptions

- Final sale items are marked on the product page and receipts. They are ineligible for returns.
- Customized bundles may be returned minus a 15% restocking fee.
- International returns require customers to prepay duties; reimburse via store credit once
  inspected.

> Support note: Offer a one-time courtesy label for first-time customers requesting a return after
> day 45 but before day 60.
