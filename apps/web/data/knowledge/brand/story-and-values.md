FMT began in a community makerspace where a group of designers prototyped modular home tech that
made sustainable living easier. Today, our products power more than 300,000 homes around the world.

## Narrative pillars

1. **Empowerment through design** – We build approachable tech that helps people take action on
   climate goals without sacrificing comfort.
2. **Circular supply chain** – 84% of our materials are recycled or upcycled, and every supplier is
   audited annually for environmental compliance.
3. **Community stewardship** – We reinvest 3% of annual profits into urban farming grants and STEM
   mentorship programs.

## Voice and tone

- Optimistic yet grounded—celebrate progress without ignoring challenges.
- Use plain language and avoid technical jargon where possible.
- Highlight people and communities benefiting from our products.
