# SUMMARY.md - Forestal MT Website

## Project Status
The Forestal MT website has been successfully built and is ready for deployment. All required pages and features from the `SITE_SPEC.md` have been implemented.

## What Was Created
- **Next.js 15 Application:** A new Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and `shadcn/ui`.
- **Product Catalog:** A script to generate a `products.json` file from source content.
- **E-commerce Pages:** Shop grid, product detail pages with "Request Bulk Pricing" modal.
- **Static Pages:** Home, About, Contact, FAQ, Shipping, Sourcing, and Testimonials pages.
- **Engagement Features:** Floating social and WhatsApp icons, global CTA.
- **SEO:** `next-seo` and `next-sitemap` integration with JSON-LD structured data.

## TODOs
- **Stripe Integration:** The Stripe Checkout functionality needs to be implemented.
- **Content:** The placeholder content on the static pages needs to be replaced with the actual content from the source of truth.
- **Styling:** The styling is basic and needs to be refined to match the brand's aesthetic.
- **Navigation:** The main navigation and footer need to be implemented.

## Next Steps to Go Live
1. **Implement Stripe Checkout:** Integrate the Stripe API to handle payments.
2. **Populate Content:** Replace all placeholder text and images with the final content.
3. **Finalize Styling:** Work with a designer to implement the final design.
4. **Deploy:** Deploy the application to a hosting provider like Vercel or Netlify.
