## Who We Are

### I INTRODUCE TO YOU, FORESTAL MT:

**Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L. de C.V.**

**Exporting Nature Without Borders**

**A Honduran Family Enterprise**

Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L. de C.V. is a Honduran family-run company founded in 2009 by the Murillo Tejada family. We operate from San Francisco de la Paz, Olancho, Honduras.

We source and export premium ethnobotanical treasures from Honduras to global markets. Our work is built on three foundations: family traditions, sustainable management of natural resources, and respect for our ancestors.

We specialize in artisanal and wild-harvested products through three distinct product lines. Each product carries the spirit of Honduras and represents centuries of indigenous knowledge.

Beyond our core product lines, we operate as a diversified enterprise engaged in international exports, real estate development, local commerce, agriculture, and livestock. This diversification reflects our commitment to resilience and long-term growth.

### Our Journey of Growth

In the early 1990s, Nery Roberto Murillo Montalván entered the lumber industry with no prior resources. Through determination and learning, he advanced from basic lumbering into the acquisition of pine forests in Honduras. He accumulated more than 5,000 hectares of sustainably managed forest.

When the family formally founded Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L. de C.V. in 2009, those assets were transferred from his personal ownership into the company. Forestal MT began as a family-run business with a solid foundation.

Initially focused on timber extraction, the company later shifted to pine resin exports. After regulatory changes and global price downturn, operations slowed. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Forestal MT underwent a restructuring process led by the Murillo Tejada family. A consensus-based ownership structure was reinforced, maintaining the co-founding partners strictly within the family.

Inspired by collaboration with Miskito communities, Batana Oil was introduced as a new cornerstone product. Starting with small local sales, the company rebuilt with a focus on traceability, compliance, and ancestral respect.

Through this transformation, Forestal MT expanded into three main product lines: Batana Oil (Ancestral Miskito Elixir), Melipona Honey (The Mayans' Heritage), and Traditional Herbs (Sacred Wisdom Rooted in Nature).

Forestal MT now serves clients internationally across multiple regions. What began with one handmade bottle in Olancho has grown into a global network for fair, traceable, and culturally respectful trade.

Today, Forestal MT stands as a bridge between ancestral knowledge and global markets. We prove that Honduras can compete in premium markets when products are managed with excellence, respect for origin, and full traceability.

### Our Mission

### What Makes Us Different

#### Ancestral Indigenous Wisdom

Our products are not formulated in a lab. They are born from centuries of ethnobiological knowledge passed down through Honduran indigenous communities like the Miskito people. This provides time-tested efficacy that modern science is only beginning to understand.

#### Artisanal & Wild-Harvested Purity

We source exclusively from pristine ecosystems, far from industrial pollution. We use traditional, non-industrial methods including wild-harvesting and shade-drying to preserve the full potency and integrity of each ingredient. Products remain as close to their natural state as possible.

#### Authentic Narrative as Intellectual Property

Our most defensible asset is our verifiable narrative. Each product is a cultural artifact with a traceable origin, connecting consumers directly to the land, community, and traditions it comes from. This story cannot be reverse-engineered or replicated by competitors.

#### Bridging Ancestral Wisdom & Modern Wellness

We translate ancient remedies into accessible, reliable solutions for a global audience. We meet the modern consumer's demand for authentic, holistic alternatives to synthetic products.

#### Vertically Integrated Forest-to-Customer Supply Chain

We source directly from native regions and indigenous communities. This full control removes middlemen and provides unparalleled transparency, superior quality control, and absolute certainty of ethical and sustainable practices.

#### Verifiable Chain of Authenticity

From forest to customer. Complete transparency at every step. Direct-from-origin. Zero compromises.

**1. Wild Harvest:** Indigenous artisans harvest from pristine forests using ancestral methods

**2. Traditional Processing:** Artisanal extraction and shade-drying preserve natural potency

**3. Quality Control:** Rigorous testing and documentation for every batch

**4. Export Ready:** Complete COAs, MSDS, and compliance documentation

**5. Direct to You:** Traceable origin with no intermediaries or dilution

### Our Values

#### Authenticity

All products are sourced directly from pristine forests, indigenous communities, and native regions in Honduras. This provides a verifiable origin and an unbroken chain of trust.

#### Quality & Integrity

We use time-honored, artisanal methods to preserve the full spectrum of each plant's natural potency and purity. Industrial processing cannot replicate this.

#### Excellence

Meticulous sourcing, robust export documentation, and uncompromising quality that consistently delivers premium products.

#### Trust & Relationships

Our business is built on long-term partnerships rather than transactions. Honesty, reliability, and mutual growth define our interactions with partners, suppliers, and customers.

### Our Brand Promise

**Heritage you can verify. Quality you can measure. Sourcing you can trust.**

**Exporting Nature Without Borders**

This slogan expresses Forestal MT's identity and international purpose. It shows the world that Honduras can compete in global markets. It stands as proof that Honduran people are capable of exporting high-quality natural products, branding them successfully, and positioning them among the most demanding and competitive markets in the world.

#### Echo of Honduras' Living Landscapes

We stand as the Echo of Honduras' Living Landscapes. We offer a tribute to the sacred relationship between the land and its people. We honor the indigenous communities who are the ancestral protectors of these ecosystems.

We tell specific, tangible stories. Batana oil crafted by Miskito artisans in La Mosquitia. Stingless bee honey wild-harvested deep in pristine forests. Traditional herbs meticulously shade-dried in the mountains to preserve their supportive ethnobotanical properties.

### Market Position: Truth Over Claims

The natural products market is saturated with unsubstantiated claims and diluted authenticity. Forestal MT operates differently.

We provide a verifiable chain of authenticity from forest to customer. Every product carries documentation. Every batch is traceable. Every claim is substantiated.

We are not retailers who source from brokers. We are not middlemen who rebrand generic ingredients. We source directly from indigenous communities in Honduras. We control the entire supply chain from harvest to export.

Our products deliver value across three dimensions:

**Purity**: Wild-harvested from pristine ecosystems. No industrial contamination. No synthetic additives. No dilution.

**Potency**: Traditional processing methods preserve full ethnobotanical properties. Artisanal techniques that industrial operations cannot replicate.

**Cultural Integrity**: Each product carries centuries of indigenous knowledge. Sacred practices passed through generations. Cultural heritage embedded in every container.

We are standard bearers of authenticity in an industry that trades on it but rarely delivers it.
